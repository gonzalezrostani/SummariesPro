This is called an “earworm.” More than 90% of people in surveys say they experience earworms at least once a week. Although they are common, scientists have only recently started studying them closely.

Studies in the U.S., Britain, and Finland show that earworms usually come from songs you’ve heard recently. These songs often have catchy parts, maybe a sudden change in rhythm or a unique melody, that make them easier to remember. The part that sticks is often short and repeats easily in your mind.

Earworms tend to appear when people are doing routine things, like walking, cleaning, or driving. Research also shows that women report more earworms than men and that older people tend to have them less often.

Why do earworms seem more common now? One theory is that we are constantly exposed to music - on phones, in stores, and online. The more we hear a song, the more likely it is to get stuck. But sometimes an earworm is triggered without hearing the song. For example, seeing someone who looks like a singer you know can suddenly make one of their songs pop into your head.

Most earworms are harmless and go away on their own. Some people find them annoying, while others enjoy them. Scientists are still trying to understand why they happen, how long they last, and whether they serve any purpose. For now, they remain a strange but familiar part of everyday life.","**Main Idea:**  
Earworms, or songs that get stuck in one's head, are a common phenomenon experienced by over 90% of people weekly, yet they have only recently become a focus of scientific study.

**Key Information:**  
Research from the U.S., Britain, and Finland indicates that earworms typically originate from recently heard songs, particularly those with catchy melodies or rhythms. They often arise during routine activities like walking or cleaning, and studies show that women experience them more frequently than men, while older individuals report them less often. The prevalence of earworms may be linked to our constant exposure to music through various media. Interestingly, they can also be triggered by visual cues, such as seeing someone who resembles a singer. While most earworms are harmless and fade away, they can be either enjoyable or annoying to individuals.

**Significance:**  
Understanding earworms can shed light on memory, cognition, and the effects of music in our daily lives, prompting further exploration into their psychological and neurological implications.",make it shorter,"**Main Idea:**
